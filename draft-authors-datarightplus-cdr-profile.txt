1.  Scope

   The scope of this document is intended to be the combinatorial
   outcome of a variety of specifications to achieve a compliant outcome
   within the Australian Consumer Data Right.  Because this document
   relates to a specific ecosystem deployment it contains static
   configuration information.

   This document *does not* seek to navigate the complexities of
   [CDR-RULES] but rather to establish a technical baseline to consider
   these in each implementors context.

2.  Terminology

   This specification utilises the various terms outlined within
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-ROSETTA].

   Banking Sector  TODO
   Energy Sector  TODO
   Designated Sector  TODO

3.  Providers

   Providers are required to deliver authorisation and resource
   requirements.  They are also required to integrate with the Ecosystem
   Authority in the prescribed way.

3.1.  Information Security

   Providers MUST:

   1.  comply with the Provider provisions described in
       [DATARIGHTPLUS-INFOSEC-BASELINE-00];
   2.  comply with the provisions outlined in
       [DATARIGHTPLUS-ADMISSION-CONTROL-BASELINE-00];
   3.  comply with the provisions outlined in
       [DATARIGHTPLUS-SHARING-ARRANGEMENT-V1-00];
   4.  support the following acr claim and validate the Consumer with
       the following values:
       1.  urn:cds.au:cdr:2 where the authentication achieved matches
           the Credential Level CL1 from [TDIF] or;
       2.  urn:cds.au:cdr:3 where the authentication achieved matches
           the Credential Level CL2 from [TDIF]
   5.  incorporate One-Time Passwords as part of the requirement to
       achieve the minimum acceptable value for the acr claim and:
       1.  MUST be delivered using existing and preferred channels
       2.  MUST be numeric digits and be between 4 and 6 digits in
           length
       3.  MUST only be valid for the purposes of establishing
           authorisations between Provider and Initiators
       4.  MUST be invalidated after a reasonable period of time
   6.  MUST authenticate a confidential client with using
       private_key_jwt specified in section 9 of [OIDC-Core] with a
       client identifier of cdr-register
   7.  MUST supply a scope value of admin:metrics.basic:read for all
       successful authentications of the cdr-register client identifier

   _Note:_ The CDR currently mandates, essentially exclusively, the use
   of One-Time Passwords while restricting the introduction of
   additional "friction" via other factors.  It is understood this is
   currently being reconsidered.

3.2.  Resource Server

   Providers operating within the Banking Sector MUST comply with the
   provisions outlined in [DATARIGHTPLUS-RESOURCE-SET-COMMON-00] and
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-RESOURCE-SET-BANKING-00].

   Providers operating within the Energy Sector MUST comply with the
   provisions outlined in [DATARIGHTPLUS-RESOURCE-SET-COMMON-00] and
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-RESOURCE-SET-ENERGY-00].

3.2.1.  Metrics

   In addition to the aforementioned requirements Providers MUST deliver
   protected resource(s), in accordance with
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-REDOCLY-ID1], as follows:

    +==========================+==========================+===========+
    | Resource Server Endpoint | Required Scope           | Valid x-v |
    +==========================+==========================+===========+
    | GET /admin/metrics       | admin:metrics.basic:read | 5         |
    +--------------------------+--------------------------+-----------+

                                  Table 1

4.  Initiators

   Initiators are required to comply with Ecosystem Authority
   requirements and integrate with Providers in prescribed ways.

   Within the Australian CDR Initiators are commonly referred to as
   Software Products.

4.1.  Information Security

   Initiators MUST: 1. comply with the Initiator provisions described in
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-INFOSEC-BASELINE-00]; 1. comply with the provisions
   outlined in [DATARIGHTPLUS-ADMISSION-CONTROL-BASELINE-00]; 1. comply
   with the provisions outlined in
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-SHARING-ARRANGEMENT-V1-00];

4.2.  Resource Server Client

   Initiators MUST access Provider resource server infrastructure in
   accordance with: 1.  [DATARIGHTPLUS-INFOSEC-BASELINE-00] and; 2.
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-RESOURCE-SET-COMMON-00] and; 3.
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-RESOURCE-SET-BANKING-00] and; 4.
   [DATARIGHTPLUS-RESOURCE-SET-ENERGY-00]

5.  Ecosystem Authority

   The Ecosystem Authority MUST comply with the requirements outlined
   within [DATARIGHTPLUS-ADMISSION-CONTROL-BASELINE-00].

   The Ecosystem Authority for the Australian CDR is the Australian
   Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)
   (https://www.accc.gov.au/).

5.1.  Accreditation

   The Ecosystem Authority performs external validation of participant
   capabilities, particularly of the Initiator Entity.

   This occurs by way of a combination of Ecosystem Authority
   verification, external technology audit standards (notably ASAE3150)
   and legal assertions by a Initiator Entity carrying higher
   accreditation as to the suitability of new subordinate Initiator
   Entities.

   As a result of this validation Initiator Entities are granted an
   accreditation status which in turn influences the authorisation
   scopes that are made available to thee relevant Initiator.  Further
   detail on this process in the context of the CDR can be found within
   the [CDR-RULES] and within guidelines published on the CDR website
   (https://cdr.gov.au).

   The subject of accreditation is not intended to be covered by this
   specification.  As a consequence this document focuses primarily on
   the relationship between Provider and Initiator with the Ecosystem
   Authority providing third party assurance with respect to technical
   admission control.

6.  Electricity Authority

   The Electricity Authority MUST comply with the relevant provisions
   outlined within [DATARIGHTPLUS-RESOURCE-SET-ENERGY-00].

   The Electricity Authority for the Australian CDR is the Australian
   Energy Market Operator (AEMO) (https://aemo.com.au/en).

7.  Electricity Plan Website

   The Electricity Plan Website MUST comply with the relevant provisions
   outlined within [DATARIGHTPLUS-RESOURCE-SET-ENERGY-00].

   The Electricity Plan Website for the Australian CDR is Energy Made
   Easy (https://energymadeeasy.gov.au/) operated by the Australian
   Energy Regulator (https://www.aer.gov.au/).

8.  Implementation Considerations

   Where One-Time Password OTP are in use the generation method SHOULD
   incorporate controls, such as retry limits, to minimise the risk of
   enumeration attacks.
